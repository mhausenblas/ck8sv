# Current Kubernetes Versions

This site keeps track of the currently supported Kubernetes version(s) across notable distributions. We try to update it at least after every minor Kubernetes upstream release (for example, 1.11 to 1.12).

The current Kubernetes version, as of 2018-09-27, is [1.12](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.12.0).

In alphabetical order, the current supported version in the following distributions is:
